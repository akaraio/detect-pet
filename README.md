# detect-pet

The code creates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of pets on backgrounds, where each image includes the pet's location and class label. The network consists of two models: a generator that produces synthetic images of pets on backgrounds and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and fake images. The code also includes a prediction function that takes an input image and uses the trained model to detect the presence of a pet, its location, and class label in the image.
